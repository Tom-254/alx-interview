"""A program that solves the N-Queens puzzle.

The N-Queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an
NÃ—N chessboard.

Usage:
    python nqueens.py N

where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4.

If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage:
nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1.

If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and
exit with the status 1.

If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line,
and exit with the status 1.

The program should return an array of every possible solution to the problem.
